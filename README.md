This repository contains all R scripts to perform the analysis in our manuscript, ["Precise identification of cancer cells from allelic imbalances in single cell transcriptomes."](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.25.469995v1)

`alleleIntegrator` is an R package that integrates whole genome sequencing of tumour DNA and single cell RNA sequencing of a tumour to identify which single cells are cancer derived. For a detailed description of the method, as well as a vignette, please visit https://github.com/constantAmateur/alleleIntegrator
